Team Contract (vasilis2-suhaasn3-quinnd2-yacineb2)

**Communication**

**1. Team Meetings:** Our team will meet every weekend unless changed ahead of time at the

ECEB (preferable) or Siebel. However, we will meet up more than once over the fall break to

speed up the process. If one of the members cannot make it in-person we will meet online via

Zoom. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with quinnd2. Notes

will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also

responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the

team at the start of the following week’s meeting.

**2. Assistance:** Each team member will be primarily contacted through Discord. If there is no

response, then they will be contacted via email. We acknowledge that some of us do not already

check Discord that often, so we agree to check for any updates multiple times every day.

**3. Respect:** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly

meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak

or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project.

All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred,

it is not required.There will be no insults to the intelligence of any group member while making

technical decisions during the project. By signing this document, each member of the team

commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

**Collaboration**

**1. Work Distribution:** Each team member will be expected to contribute to a weekly

deliverable. The weekly deliverables will be discussed during meetings and will be distributed as

equally as possible among all members. Every member will get the same amount of overall

workload over the project time period. If a certain member gets a lighter workload during a

week, he should expect to be assigned a heavier workload in the following week in order to

balance overall workloads.

**2. Time Commitment:** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to

independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project.

If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist

with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or

programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to

make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. However if a team member is

habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their





circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may

be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.

**3. Conflict Resolution:** All conflicts will be resolved internally. If it reaches the point of no

return, it is imperative on both parties to report it to the advisor and they will sort it out.

For minor disputes, a game of the majority party’s (or dissenting party in the case that we are

evenly split) choice may be used to resolve the dispute. A tally will be kept of whoever loses

during the disagreements, and whoever has the most tallies has to treat us to dinner once the

project is over at a non-fast food establishment (their choice).

For agreement, each of us should sign our names here at the bottom with an electronic signature

and a separate github commit over the same document.

**Signature:**

I, Quinn Doud (quinnd2) agree to all terms in this contract.
I, Suhaas Narayan (suhaasn3) agree to all terms in this contract.
